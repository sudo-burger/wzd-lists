# WZD Lists
A set of host and IP address lists that should be useful to setup [DNS reverse
policy
zones](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-vixie-dnsop-dns-rpz-00.html#rfc.abstract).

* wzd-host-whitelist.txt
  * Based on Amazon's current list of most popular web sites.
* wzd-host-blacklist.txt
  * Based on various lists of malware sites, trackers, ads, and other
    nuisances.
* wzd-ip-blacklist.txt
  * Based on similar data as the blacklist, but contains IP ranges rather than
    host names.
